This is a small guide on the best practices for documenting our code

1.
We use 4 spaces for line starts
example:

def add(a):
    for i in range(6):
        print(a + i)

2. 
Use camelCase for variable names 
example: exampleVariable

3. 
Use snake_case in all caps for constants 
example: THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT

4. 
Define all global variables and constants at the top of the file

5. 
All code files should start with a DOCSTRING, a multiline comment that explains what happens in this file 
example: 

"""
This file contains the functionality for ...

Here is some helpful information you should know
"""

6.
Document code as well as possible, don't overdo it
example:

#this function adds two numbers after doubling the first
def add(a, b):
    #this is where the first number 
    a = a*2
    #this is where the numbers are added and the result returned
    return a + b

short comments can also be in line
example:

def add(a, b):
    a = a*2    #doubles first number
    return a + b    #adds and returns result

7.
Spaces make code readable. Use them!
examples:

x = y + z

print("x is equal to " + x)
